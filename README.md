# About
This android app was fully realized as a project for the end of year exam, it allows you to manage your workout plan (unfortunately it was designed in single frequency) and was developed in Android Studio (Java), PHP and SQL (MariaDB).

## Disclaimer
The project was developed when I was almost 18 years old, obviously I was learning and the code will probably be messy, not clear and with non-English comments or constructs.

## Phases of creation
First of all, the conceptual map was created with XMind, then the prototype and mockups were created with Balsamiq and finally the development of the app with the creation of the tables and data in SQL and the application in Android Studio.

As can be seen from the ER model, a user can create a tab that can contain the type of exercise (which in turn will be linked to the muscle entity to understand which muscle group it is aimed at), number of sets and repetitions.
